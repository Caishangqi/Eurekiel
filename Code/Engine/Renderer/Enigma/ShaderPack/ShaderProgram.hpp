     * @class ShaderProgram
     * @brief Represents a shader program used for rendering graphics.
     *
     * The ShaderProgram class is responsible for managing the compilation,
     * linking, and usage of shaders in the rendering pipeline. This includes
     * vertex shaders, fragment shaders, and other supported shader types.
     * It provides an encapsulated interface for interacting with the GPU
     * shader execution.
     *
     * Typical functionality includes loading, attaching, compiling shader
     * source code, linking the shader program, and interacting with
     * uniform variables.
     *
     * Note that the specific implementation details for this class may
     * vary depending on the underlying graphics API being used.
