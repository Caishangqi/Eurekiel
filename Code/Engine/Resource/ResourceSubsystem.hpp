/**
 * @class ResourceSubsystem
 * @brief Manages the discovery, loading, caching, and management of file system resources.
 *
 * The ResourceSubsystem is responsible for interacting with the file system to locate resources,
 * load them into memory, cache them for efficient access, and manage their lifecycles.
 *
 * This class provides an abstraction over the raw file system operations, enabling applications
 * to focus on high-level resource management without dealing with low-level details.
