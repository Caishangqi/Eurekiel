 *
 * @brief The RegisterSubsystem class is responsible for the registry mechanism of game object types,
 * modeled similarly to NeoForge's Registry/DeferredRegister.
 *
 * This class serves as the foundational subsystem for managing registrations
 * of various game object types in a structured and extensible manner.
 *
 * Users may utilize this class to implement and manage the process of registering
 * game object types, ensuring that they are recognized and properly instantiated
 * within the encompassing game framework.
